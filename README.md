A GStreamer plugin for [MoQ (Media over QUIC)](https://github.com/kixelated/moq) that enables publishing and consuming media streams using the MoQ protocol.

This plugin was originally part of the main MoQ repository but has been separated to avoid requiring GStreamer as a build dependency.

# Usage
## Requirements
- [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Setup
We use `just` to simplify the development process.
Check out the [Justfile](justfile) or run `just` to see the available commands.

Install any other required tools:
```sh
just setup
```

## Development
First make sure you have a local moq-relay server running:
```sh
just relay
```

Now you can publish and subscribe to a video:
```sh
# Publish to a localhost moq-relay server
just pub-gst bbb

# Subscribe from a localhost moq-relay server
just sub bbb
```
